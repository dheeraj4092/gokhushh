## 🚀 YOUR ACTION ITEMS (Simple 4-Step Process)

### **STEP 1: Install FFmpeg** (One-time setup, 2 minutes)
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### **STEP 2: Add Your Videos** (2 minutes)
1. Copy your 10-15 MB video files into the `original_videos/` folder
2. Rename them descriptively (e.g., `rajesh-driver.mp4`, `priya-rider.mp4`)

### **STEP 3: Run Optimization** (Automatic, 1-2 minutes per video)
```bash
./optimize-videos.sh
```

This will automatically:
- ✅ Compress videos to 3-5 MB (60-70% reduction)
- ✅ Generate poster thumbnails
- ✅ Move optimized files to correct folders

### **STEP 4: Update Component** (5 minutes)
Replace the placeholder video URLs in `TestimonialsSection.tsx`:

**Change FROM:**
```typescript
src: 'https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/...'
```

**Change TO:**
```typescript
src: '/testimonials/videos/your-video-name.mp4'
poster: '/testimonials/posters/your-video-name-poster.jpg'
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Quality:
- Keep original videos in 1080x1920 resolution (vertical)
- Use good lighting and audio in recordings
- Film in stable conditions (avoid shaky footage)

### For Smallest File Size:
- Adjust CRF value in script (higher = smaller, try 25-27)
- Record at 720p instead of 1080p if acceptable
- Keep videos under 30 seconds when possible

### For Best Performance:
- Always provide poster thumbnails (auto-generated by script)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep total size of all videos under 30 MB

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg not found"
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Videos too large after optimization?
Edit `optimize-videos.sh` and change `-crf 23` to `-crf 25`

### Videos won't play in browser?
Ensure they're:
- MP4 format
- H.264 codec
- Proper path: `/testimonials/videos/...`

### Need different quality?
```bash
# Higher quality (larger file)
-crf 20

# Lower quality (smaller file)
-crf 27
```
